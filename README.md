# YouKnowWhen_Meteor_React
A fun web app built with Meteor.js and React that takes joke like "You know you're a redneck if..." to the next level
and expands this particular joke to it's full potential.

Check out the live version here: http://youknowwhen.meteorapp.com/


It's still a work in progress, but here are some things you can do to try it out;
1) Type a letter into the first input, like 'm'
2) Use the arrow keys to scroll down the autocorrect list, and notice that it reactively populates without you having to press enter
3) Type in something to the lower input and press enter to see your phrase pop up
4) Upload an image to your phrase
5) Try typing some racial slurs into the top input to test the blacklisting.
6) Go to a category, and then try to submit a phrase that already exists.

Enjoy!
