1. blacklist
2. caps non-sensitive
3. work on banners
4. should include a banner that says "press enter to contribute to this category"
5. "Phrase added" banner would be good.
6. Prevent phrase copies from being added


styling ideas
  LOOK 1
    Get rid of input background for category.
    Center it.
    give it a fancy cursor
    8tracks style bubble suggestions with slightly varying hue
    that can be clicked or arrow-keyed through.
    sound design for clicking (with processing maybe?)

  Look Q
    animated characters walking around.

  Look Z
    These input boxes are displayed on some sort of illustrated background.




NOTES FOR JANUARY 31st
1. navigating down suggestions with arrow keys
2. click or press entered when focused to select
3. when selected, it will fill input box with that word
4. as you type, tiles appear
5. when input box gets left, dropdown goes away
6. phrase dash isn't visible as long as focus is on the category input
7. dropdown has z index? is above everything else at least
8. when you submit through category input, phrase input is automatically focused on
9. as you type in phrase input, tiles that don't include that string anywhere disappear


to do

1. make it so that,
when you do the create new category modal,
the input box doesn't "" itself.
Not sure why this happens actually. Maybe there's no 'preventDefault' for some reason?

2. make 2nd field clear when category change happens

3. when you leave 1st input, enter automatically? Or prompt the user somehow?
Michelle typed in 'unicorn' without pressing enter and it got added to 'koala'

4. make sure category calidation is caps-blind and gets rid of extra space.

5. input box is strangely too small a target to easily hit

6. cannot submit empty ""

7. make sure phrase is new, not repeat --- especially, no repeats in DATABASE. right now I have a lot of "moose"'s.

8. nav-bar words highlight blue no bueno

9.




Do the most
1. I would love to do two-way data binding, or implement whatever would be necessary
for results to show up as you typed in the first input form, rather than only afters
submit.

2. change "a" to "an" depending

3. thesaurus searching --- suggest similar words

4. finding similar phrases across categories. "This phrase is used in categories x y and z" (show links to categories).

5. autocomplete phrase input (ideally this could be done WITH thesaurus)

6. email subscribe to certain categories

7. voting arena on homepage

8. Redirect to correct domain


User Testing
1. Reach out to Michelle and a couple illustrators about how this dashboard concept looks to them
2. test it out with every iteration.
3. Animations
