essential
1. autocomplete
2. good grid styling
3. image upload
4. page routing


to do

1. make it so that,
when you do the create new category modal,
the input box doesn't "" itself.
Not sure why this happens actually. Maybe there's no 'preventDefault' for some reason?

2. make 2nd field clear when category change happens

3. when you leave 1st input, enter automatically? Or prompt the user somehow?
Michelle typed in 'unicorn' without pressing enter and it got added to 'koala'

4. make sure category calidation is caps-blind and gets rid of extra space.

5. input box is strangely too small a target to easily hit

6. cannot submit empty ""

7. make sure phrase is new, not repeat --- especially, no repeats in DATABASE. right now I have a lot of "moose"'s.

8. nav-bar words highlight blue no bueno

9.




Do the most
1. I would love to do two-way data binding, or implement whatever would be necessary
for results to show up as you typed in the first input form, rather than only afters
submit.

2. change "a" to "an" depending

3. thesaurus searching --- suggest similar words

4. finding similar phrases across categories. "This phrase is used in categories x y and z" (show links to categories).

5. autocomplete phrase input (ideally this could be done WITH thesaurus)

6. email subscribe to certain categories

7. voting arena on homepage

8. Redirect to correct domain


User Testing
1. Reach out to Michelle and a couple illustrators about how this dashboard concept looks to them
2. test it out with every iteration.
3. Animations
